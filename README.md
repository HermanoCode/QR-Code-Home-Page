I- First step: analysing the design

Try to decorticate the design provided, think first about the HTML elements. In this design, we got a main div container containing a image container containing the QR code
and a header above a paragraph.
Then imagine the classes and ids of the elements(try to brainstorm reuasable and clear classe names and try to ignore it's lenght)
